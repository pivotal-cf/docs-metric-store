## <a id='about'></a> About Metric Store

Metric Store provides a persistent storage layer for metrics sent through the Loggregator subsystem.
It is multi-tenant-aware, because the auth proxy ensures that you only have access to metrics from your
apps, and easy to query because it's compatible with
[PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).
It also has the powerful [InfluxDB storage engine](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb), which
has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index.

- **Multi-tenant aware:** Application Developers have access to their own metrics.
- **Ubiquitous Query Language:** Metric Store is compatible with PromQL and Prometheus API Query endpoints.
- **Powerful Storage Engine:** The InfluxDB storage engine has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index.

Metric Store offers multi-node deployments, data replication, hinted handoff, and load balancing in
a highly-available configuration.

> The only officially supported use case for the Metric Store product is as the backing
> Time Series Database for [App Metrics v2.2](https://docs.vmware.com/en/App-Metrics-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/app-metrics/GUID-index.html)
> and the [TAS v2.9 and later Apps Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/console-index.html).
> Use cases outside of these bounds have no guarantee of continued support or availability.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Metric Store has the following limitations:

- Horizontally scaling Metric Store currently results in data loss.
  Vertical scaling is recommended at this time.
- Platforms are ever changing and we cannot guarantee metric stability.
  Using Metric Store through products such as [App Metrics](https://docs.vmware.com/en/App-Metrics-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/app-metrics/GUID-index.html)
  or [Learning about Apps Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/console-index.html)
  are supported use cases.
  When using Metric Store manually through endpoints, you must be aware of changes through
  Platform upgrades.
